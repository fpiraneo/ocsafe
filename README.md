We know that ownCloud has it's own cryptograpy app that allows to cypher all directory contents: this may be unwanted or not applicable; in such cases, this app allows you to cypher every file with a different password keeping curious peoples away and allowing practical encrypt / decrypt sequence, directly on the folder.

IMPORTANT
Enable and be sure the mcrypt library and related php5 module are enabled under the phpinfo() page, otherwise this app never work!
