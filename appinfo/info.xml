        We know that ownCloud has it's own cryptograpy app that allows
        to cypher all directory contents: this may be unwanted or not applicable;
        in such cases, this app allows you to cypher every file with a different
        password keeping curious peoples away and allowing practical
        encrypt / decrypt sequence, directly on the folder.
